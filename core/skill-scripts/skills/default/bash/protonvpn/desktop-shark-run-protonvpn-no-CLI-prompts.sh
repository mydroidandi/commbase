# Description: Script to run Protonvpn in a terminal

# Requires:
# ssh
# screen: software to detach and re-attach terminal sessions yet open.
# openvpn
# openvpn updated from ProtonVPN documentation
# Protonvpn-cli package for debian (.deb)
# gdebi
# resolvconf
# ProtonVPN user account (Free account works)
# OpenVPN IKEv2 username and password for manual IKEv2 login or
# strongswan, libstrongswan-extra-plugins, and/or libcharon-extra-plugins
# packages, cert, and setup for ipsec and connection to the IKEv2 protocol
# without authentication.

# Kill switch:
# The ProtonVPN official Linux CLI includes a kill switch. The basic Kill Switch will block all your
# internet connections when the VPN is running and the connection to one of our servers fails. To
# enable it, enter:
protonvpn-cli ks --on
# The CLI also features a Permanent Kill Switch. This prevents all internet connections unless
# the VPN is running and connected to one of our servers. To enable it, enter:
#protonvpn-cli ks --permanent
# You can disable the Kill Switch
#protonvpn-cli ks --off

# When everything is set up and worked a previous testing time
# After logging in the first time ProtonVPN stores the password
# To up the VPN connection named "test" (see config files notes):
# The system is going to prompt for the sudo password
sudo ipsec up test
# Output: "connection 'test' established successfully"

# To disconnect the VPN:
#sudo ipsec down test

# If you make changes in the VPN configuration, for example, change a server or
# reset authentication (check out the web site account), we need to restart
# the service using the command:
#sudo ipsec restart
# or use:
#sudo systemctl restart ipsec
