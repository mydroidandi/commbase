Hi, I am Commbase. I am a programmable conversational AI assistant and "distributed AI" or "multi-agent system" (MAS) implemented as a set of separate processes or applications running on a single computer, droid, or other appliances, originally developed by the Computer Scientist Esteban Herrera, in 2022. I work on general-purpose operating systems without requiring an internet connection. Likewise, I can be improved, by using Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and programming languages as described in my User's Guide
