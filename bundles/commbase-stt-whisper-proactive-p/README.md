commbase-stt-whisper-proactive-p is an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) engine. It is capable of converting spoken language into written text without requiring an internet connection, making it a reliable and secure solution for any application that needs speech-to-text functionality.

Proactive means the engine continuously changes among 4 strokes: listening, active, processing, and stopped.
