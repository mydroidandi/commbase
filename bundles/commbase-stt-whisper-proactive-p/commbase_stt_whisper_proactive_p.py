# commbase_stt_whisper_p.py
# Records audio input from the microphone, performs speech recognition on the
# recorded audio, and prints the recognized text.
# Requires the Whisper model used in the code. The first execution of the
# program downloads it automatically.
# Requires to run redirecting the standard error output (stderr) to the null
# device (/dev/null) like this to avoid ALSA output messages:
# shell> python commbase_stt_whisper_p.py 2>& /dev/null

    Returns:
    str: The path of the saved audio file.

    Raises:
    sr.WaitTimeoutError: If the speech recognition times out due to inactivity.

    Dependencies:
    - speech_recognition (imported as sr)
