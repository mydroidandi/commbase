File: INSTALL
Description: Commbase installation steps.
Notice that this file contains the Commbase version with Vosk, which allows Commbase to work locally 
without requiring any Internet connection to process the voice-recognition. However many commands 
will fail without connection. Any other installation requirement for alternative voice-recognition 
methods will be placed in their respective method directory as it is added to the Commbase 
application and tested.

----------------
1. Installation
----------------

Set up your system repository sources:
---------------------------------------
For example, in GNU/Debian Linux, add the sources contrib and non-free in the file
/etc/apt/sources
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources

Update the system:
-------------------
$ sudo apt-get update
You can also upgrade it like this:
$ sudo apt-get -u upgrade

Make the $COMMBASE directory:
------------------------------

Go to the directory where commbase has been cloned or downloaded and unzipped,
for example, /home/<user>/:
$ cd $HOME/

Go to the directory commbase/core, and open the file set-commbase-environment-variable.sh
to setup your $COMMBASE directory.

The section to update in the file will look like this:

```shell
[...]
if [[ ! -d "$COMMBASE" ]]; then 
    echo "" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "# The Commbase directory for the Bash shell" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export COMMBASE="$HOME"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "" >> ~/.zshrc
    echo "# The Commbase directory for the Z shell" >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'export COMMBASE="$HOME"' >> ~/.zshrc
fi
[...]

```

Save the file changes and then execute the script to set the $COMMBASE directory variable
for your bash shell:
$ bash set-commbase-environment-variable.sh

Commbase users who want to develop or customize the application would prefer putting Commbase
in a "Developer" directory such as $HOME/Developer

To know more on how to make Commbase commands, checkout the section "The $COMMBASE directory" in the
section "Commands setup" in the User's Guide.

Install Commbase:
------------------
Visit: COMMBASE GITHUB
Download and extract/Clone the repository from github.com and place it in the $COMMBASE directory:
$ echo $HOME
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone COMMBASE

-------------------------------
2. Requisites and dependencies
-------------------------------

Install Python:
----------------
python3.7
$ sudo apt-get update
$ apt-cache search python 3.7
$ sudo apt-get install python3.7

pip3.7:
$ /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ /usr/bin/python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ /usr/bin/python3.7 -m pip3.7 install --upgrade pip
Prints a list of installed pip packages:
$ pip list | more
$ pip3 list | more
$ pip3.7 list | more

Alternatively, you can replace Python 3.7 with Anaconda. Anaconda's Python versions are well
optimized, so the speech recognition AI is supposed to work faster than the official Python packages.
More information: https://www.anaconda.com/

After the installation of Anaconda you should see the base "(base)" in the foobar.

In case of that your system has a single Python installation using Anaconda if it set up for running
only in the Bash shell, you must enter the Bash shell before start Commbase, anaconda-navigator, or
any other Python script/program uncapable of running using the current Python's runtime that is
preinstalled within your Operating System distribution:
Example of foobar before entering Bash:
USER-NAME@shark:~$ bash
Example of foobar with Anaconda's Python, identified by the string "(base)", after entering Bash:
(base) USER-NAME@shark:~$

To install PyPi packages in the (base) in Anaconda, use the command "conda":
(base) USER-NAME@shark:~$ conda install PACKAGE-NAME

If you want to create a new Anaconda environment just for Commbase:
First, go to my repo dir (Commbase, in our case) and run:
$ conda create -n commbase_env python=3.7
$ conda activate commbase_env
Now, (commbase_env) appears in the foobar.
To install PyPi packages in the (commbase) environment in Anaconda, use the command "pip", for example:
(commbase_env) USER-NAME@shark:~$ pip install ipython

Note: Environments defined with python=3.9 works percectly and probably faster than python=3.7, but
3.7 is still the version requirement. This document would be updated for future version releases of
Python compatible with Commbase.

To deactive any repo use "deactivate":
$ conda deactivate commbase_env

Install Python packages:
-------------------------
Vosk:
$ pip3.7 install vosk
Or use:
$ python3.7 -m pip install vosk
If you can't install, check the output messages. For example, I have vosk already in the system from
a previous Kdenlive application installation (installed as a flatpak from flathub), which does not
allow me to re-installing vosk. 
OUTPUT:
Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
Requirement already satisfied: vosk in /home/esteban/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.3.22)
END OF OUTPUT:
In such case the messages reference the current python vosk package installation. In the OUTPUT case,
python is already installed in a directory of the current local user "esteban",  instead of system
wide, so there is use re-installing python3, pip3, or vosk.

PyAudio‑0.2.11:
$ pip3.7 install PyAudio‑0.2.11
Or download from pypi.org:
$ tar xvzf tar xvzf PyAudio-0.2.11.tar.gz
$ cp PyAudio-0.2.11.tar.gz $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk
$ Set up permissions for the directory:
$ chmod 755 PyAudio‑0.2.11
PyAudio‑0.2.11 requires Portaudio19 to install:
$ apt-cache search portaudio
$ sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
Information here: https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/portaudio19-dev
Install PyAudio using its simple instruction in its file INSTALL:
$ sudo python3.7 setup.py install

Subprocess.run:
Information: https://pypi.org/project/subprocess.run/
$ pip install subprocess.run
Or:
$ pip3 install subprocess.run

Sounddevice:
This package allows us to run the test test_microphone.py
$ pip3 install sounddevice

colorama-0.4.4:
$ pip install colorama
Or:
$ pip3 install colorama

Install the Vosk model:
------------------------
Currently, Commbase works only in English.
Visit: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
Download the model manually or using commands:
$ cd ~/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/voice-recognition
$ wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip
Extract the model:
$ unzip vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip
Rename vosk-model-en-us-0.22 as model:
$ mv vosk-model-en-us-0.22 model
$ Set up permissions for the directory:
$ chmod 755 model
Delete the big zip file:
$ rm -rf vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip

Install the required system dependency packages:
-------------------------------------------------
Package Names and commands should be verified after during the Commbase installation. To verify
packages you can use:
$ whereis <PACKAGE>
$ whereis <COMMAND>.

I explain it because names and commands could change from distro to distro or even from release to a
newer release of the same distro):
alsamixer
aplay
awk
bash
curl
ecsound
festival
git
mpv
mplayer
nmap
openssh-server (server and client)
pkill
rsync
sed
sh
sox
sudo
tasksel
tmux
uuid-runtime
wget

In Debian, the DPKG packages that contain all the required commands can be installed using apt. Apt
manages and installs the package dependencies automatically:
bash
curl
festival
ffmpeg
git
mpv
mplayer
nmap
openssh-server
rsync
sed
sox
sudo
tasksel
tmux
uuid-runtime
wget

** Packages unfound by their given names can be replaced in the source by their respective command
line versions your favorite OS distribution.

Use APT to install packages from the official repositories for your distro, I.e.:
$ sudo apt-get install <PACKAGE-NAME> <PACKAGE-NAME2> <PACKAGE-NAM3> <...>

To verify that a package is present in the system:
$ dpkg -l | grep <PACKAGE-NAME>
Example:
$ dpkg -l | grep bash

Install VU-meter:
------------------
Download/clone it from github and install it:
$ cd $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk
$ git clone https://github.com/kmein/vu-meter.git
Rename the directory:
$ mv vu-meter-master vu-meter
Change directory permissions:
$ ls -hal vu-meter
$ chmod 755 vu-meter

Install Oh My Tmux:
--------------------
Download/clone it from github and install it:
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git
$ ln -s -f .tmux/.tmux.conf
$ cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .

Install the default Commbase voice commands dependencies:
----------------------------------------------------------
The applications to run by voice commands can be replaced at any moment and grow by a commands'
creator, or in other words, a Commbase Instructor. For example replace VS Code by Gedit, VIM, etc.,
but having installed these as a minimum to test all teh commmands available in the initial Commbase
installation.
Here is the little list:
Brave browser
Etherape
Gnome terminal
Midori
Nano
Neofetch
ProtonVPN
VS Code

Install Desktop Environments:
------------------------------
Install a Desktop Environments such as Cinnamon, which can save you some time installing applications
automatically. However, you need free space on disk to do so, so its complete installation is not
recommended on IoTs with low hard drive space available.
Check free space like this:
$ df -h
To install/Remove Desktop Environments:
$ sudo tasksel

--------------------------------
3. Installations for Developers
--------------------------------

Install the Vosk-API (x86_64 / AMD64):
---------------------------------------
** This is not required, but its download could be useful for developers:
Visit: https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api
Download and extract/clone the repository from github.com and place it in
$HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/:
$ cd $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/
$ git clone git@github.com:alphacep/vosk-api.git
Rename the directory:
$ mv vosk-api-master vosk-api
$ Set up permissions for the directory:
$ chmod 755 vosk-api

--------------------------
4. Testing the Vosk model
--------------------------

Go to $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/voice-recognition:
$ cd ~/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/voice-recognition

$ Set up permissions for the files:
$ chmod 755 test_ffmpeg.py
$ chmod +x test_ffmpeg.py
$ chmod 755 test_microphone.py
$ chmod +x test_microphone.py
$ chmod 444 test.wav

Run the test file test_ffmpeg.py:
$ python3 test_ffmpeg.py test.wav
CORRECT OUTPUT ENDS WITH:
"text" : "zero one eight zero three"
}
END OF OUTPUT.

Run the test file test_microphone.py:
$ python3 test_microphone.py
Practice your speaking accuracy.

-------------------------------
5. Make the scripts executable
-------------------------------
$ ls -hal +x $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/commbase*
$ chmod +x $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/commbase*
$ ls -hal $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/process-templates/commbase*
$ chmod +x $HOME/Commbase/commbase/base-vosk/process-templates/commbase*

-----------------------------------------------------------
6. How to apply directory and file permissions recursively
-----------------------------------------------------------
This command applies 755 permissions to every directory and file inside the given directory, except
for those that you don't have permissions on, for example, files owned by the root user. That command
would throw a list of the files with permissions that could not be changed in the output.
$ chmod 755 -R chmod -R 755 <DIRECTORY-NAME>

Run that command once to apply 755 directory and file permissions on the initial Commbase directory:
$ chmod 755 -R chmod -R 755 $HOME/Commbase
Or whenever the Commbase directory is:
$ chmod 755 -R chmod -R 755 $HOME/Developer/Commbase

AVOID running the command after the initial Commbase installation as per our Commbase bash directory
database grows and the command would change permissions on files you don't want to change the
permissions to. To know more on how to make Commbase commands, checkout the section "Commands setup"
in the User's Guide.

---------------------------------------
7. Add the Commbase executable command
---------------------------------------
As user root, paste the file 'commbase' in /usr/bin
$ su -
And then enter your root user's password
Give file permissions:
# sudo chmod 755 commbase
The owner and group of the file must be set to root
Make it executable:
$ sudo chmod +x commbase

Close and reopen the terminal and run from the terminal as user:
$ commbase start|stop

To run existent terminal commands, for example:
$ commbase 'tell me about yourself'
$ commbase "introduce yourself"

Remember that the command 'commbase' is a script that opens an enhanced tmux session named as 
Commbase-0 by tmux. To avoid duplicate instances of Commbase running on the system, you need to
completely close the program before rerun it once more. Check out the section "1. Start and Stop
Commbase application" of the file User's Guide for more details regarding this topic.

----------------
8. Key bindings
----------------

A key binding is an association between a physical key on a keyboard and a parameter.

Commbase comes with a number of key binding files you can use for setting up key bindings in your
custom system configuration.

The Commbase key bindings are allocated in the directory Commbase/commbase/key-bindings.
Commbase recommends using a key binding to toggle ON/OFF the sound capture as a minimum. The file
used for that purpose is toggle-capture-on-off.sh. To set up the key binding using this file you must
use your current Desktop Environment or Window Manager key binding configuration.

For example, in Cinnamon, a Gnome based Desktop Environment, the keybinding steps are:
Go to Menu -> System Settings -> Keyboard -> shortcuts -> Categories -> Sound and Media -> Add custom
shortcut. 
Next, give the new shortcut a new name like "toggle capture ON or OFF".
Next, select the route to this file.
Next, click or tap on the button Add the keyboard shortcut. The shortcut appears in the list.
Next, click on unassigned to pick an accelerator.
Next, press the keys CTRL + SHIFT + c (all together) and then release them at a time.
Then the new key binding appears on the list.
Finally, verify that the key binding works.
Note: The choice to use or avoid this key binding would depend on a variety of facts. For example, you
would choose not to use the key binding if you have a headset, ear-set or any other microphone with a
built-in mute/unmute control button.  

Check out the directory key-bindings for alternative keybinding options.

Check out the section Keyboard Shortcuts of the User's Guide for a complete list of the shortcuts available.

----------------------------------
9. Run Commbase at system boot up
----------------------------------

Add the command 'commbase' with parameter 'commbase start' pointing to the file
commbase-vosk-start.sh to the proper system runlevels as a Init or Systemd script.
Add the command 'commbase' with parameter 'commbase stop' pointing to the file
commbase-vosk-start.sh to the proper system runlevels as a Init or Systemd script.

------------------------------------------------
10. Setup a network of multiple Commbase devices
------------------------------------------------

A Commbase network can be described as a decentralized operating system network. A default Commbase
device network is composed by independent nodes (devices). Every Commbase network host runs its own
tasks, configured in a local copy of the Commbase software with individual setup just to make sure
that: 1. the setup works for the specific node hardware, 2. every node can communicate one another
without depending on the network or any other Commbase network member, and 3. every node runs a
custom Commbase application and setup that allows the node receiving external Commbase commands based
on the node role and nature, through the node network, what it means that a specified Commbase copy
can work as the Commbase manager, "master", or main Commbase entity.

A network requires every node setup with OpenSSH tunneling communication among all the Commbase
network members. It is a good idea to setup OpenVPN for the nodes to avoid being attacked.

If your setup includes the Commbase manager or main node in a Commbase network and you have improved
security, you can manage nodes passwords in the Commbase .env file and use them in your scripts
passing them as parameters or flags with arguments, for example, with ssh and something like:
$ command -p PASS-STRING -m 20 --verbose

Check out the section "The Commbase processing file" of the User's Guide for more information on how
to setup specific node hardware such as intelligent home appliances or any other IoT like device.
