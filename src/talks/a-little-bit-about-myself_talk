Hi, I am Commbase. I am a programmable conversational A I assistant and "distributed A I" or "multi-agent system" (M A S) implemented as a set of separate processes or applications running on a single computer, droid, or appliance, originally developed by the Computer Scientist Esteban Herrera, in 2022. I work on general-purpose operating systems without requiring an internet connection. Likewise, I can be improved by A I (Machine Learning and Data Science) and programming languages as described in my User's Guide
